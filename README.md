UDUAVENTRY, a Technological Solution that aims to empower businesses to optimize their operations, enhance 
decision-making, and ultimately contribute to the 
growth of the SME sector in Africa.   This project bridges the technology gap faced by SMEs in Africa due to lack of access to modern inventory management technology tailored to their specific needs; hence, limiting their ability to compete in a rapidly evolving market.  The goal is to implement a user-friendly, localized Inventory Management App tailored for African SMEs.
